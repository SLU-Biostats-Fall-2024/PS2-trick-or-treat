## PS2 feedback
Thanks for paying attention to how to name your repo. Few folks did that little detail properly!

I'd like to see you do more to provide commentary after you execute a code chunk to write down what is important/what you learned/what you need to know based on the output of whatever functions you run.

Remember that not all character data should be factor data - only if the data are indicative of categories for a variable. So I don't think costume should be a factor.

You did a good job error checking your factor variables, but didn't do any error checking of your numeric variables.

Line 75 - you have an issue here with "size = 10" that shows up in the legend in your plot. Take a look at the key for more details.

Lines 102 - 112 - you were suppossed to make the table open in a new tab. You needed to add `View()` at the end of your piping.

Overall though, good job!
